# moos-ivp_processes
MOOS-IvP processes: new processes for use with MOOS-IvP.

For MOOS-IvP see http://moos-ivp.org/

You can build the processes in-repo, just make sure to add them to
your PATH environment variable for instant use.

pLonLatToWptUpdate is dependent on MOOSGeodesy, and only builds if found.
